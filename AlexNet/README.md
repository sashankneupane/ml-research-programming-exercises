# AlexNet on ImageNet dataset in PyTorch
AlexNet is a convolutional neural network structure proposed by Alex Krizhevsky et al. in 2012. It was the winner of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2012 (ILSVRC2012). It was one of the first models that popularized the use of convolutional neural networks in computer vision.

This is a simple implementation of AlexNet on ImageNet dataset using PyTorch.
